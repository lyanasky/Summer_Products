About The Company
Wish is an American online e-commerce platform for transactions between sellers and buyers. Wish was founded in 2010 by Piotr Szulczewski (former CEO) and Danny Zhang (former CTO).

Wish is currently operated by ContextLogic Inc. in San Francisco, United States, pending the completion of a sale to Qoo10 initiated in February 2024. The platform personalizes the shopping experience visually for each customer, rather than relying only on a search bar format. It allows sellers to list their products on Wish and sell directly to consumers. Wish works with payment service providers to handle payments and does not stock the products themselves or manage returns.

Description
This dataset contains product listings as well as product ratings and sales performance, from the Wish e-commerce website.

Collection Methodology
The data comes from the Wish platform. The data was scraped in the French localization (hence some non-ascii Latin characters such as « é » and « à ») in the title column.

Business Task
Re-stocking products with the best potential is crucial for shops and businesses around the world.

Through this dataset and task, you are requested to build a model that can help predict how well a product is going to sell.

Such a model has many implications and could be used in many different ways, the most straightforward being to adjust how much of a product should be kept in stock.

This would allow you to better understand e-commerce sales and get you a certain expertise for helping businesses optimize their stocks and sales.
